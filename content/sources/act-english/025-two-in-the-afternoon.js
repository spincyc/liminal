  title: "The House at Two in the Afternoon",
  content: `[1] My mother worked nights at a hospital for eleven years, which
{1 means} that for eleven years our house ran on a {2 rule between} eight in the
morning and three in the afternoon, it was the middle of the night.

[2] {3} We learned the floor. There {4 are} a board in the upstairs hall that
speaks if you put weight on the middle of it and says nothing at the {5 edge, I
could cross that hall} at eleven years old without a sound. My brother could
not, and never learned, and I have thought since that this was {6 less a matter
of skill and more about skill not being the issue}.

[3] The rule was not enforced. {7 Woken by any noise at all, my mother never
once came out of that room to tell us to be quiet.} She did not have to, because
the alternative was {8 worse, she would come down at three} with a face that had
not slept, and make dinner anyway, and we would understand exactly what it had
{9 run her}.

[4] {10 Similarly,} what I did not understand until much later was that she
never told us it was hard. Eleven years, and I cannot remember a single
complaint about the hours. I took {11 that} at the time as evidence that the
hours were fine.

[5] I am not quiet by nature. I talk over people. But I still know where that
board is, and I have {12 never in my life let a door close behind me on its
own}, and I never {13 will}.

[6] {14} The house was sold in 2019. {15} I would still be able to cross that
hall.`,
