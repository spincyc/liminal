  title: "A Rule Nobody Wrote",
  content: `[1] The quiet car began as a complaint. In 1999 a group of commuters
on a Philadelphia line asked whether one car might be set aside for people who
did not want to hear anyone's telephone. They were regular riders who had shared
the same carriage every weekday morning for years, and what they wanted was
modest and specific. The railroad agreed to try {1 it on one
train nobody} expected it to last.

[2] {2 Similarly,} the experiment had no enforcement behind it. There {3 was}
only a sign, and beyond the {4 railroad's} sign there was nothing but whatever
the passengers were willing to do.

[3] What happened next is the part worth recording. Passengers enforced it
themselves, through gestures nobody had agreed on in advance: a look, a tap on a
seatback, a finger raised to the {5 lips, the gestures were remarkably
consistent} from car to car. Within a few years riders who had never met were
policing {6 a standard that was unwritten and not written down}.

[4] {7 Consequently,} the railroad expanded the programme and other systems
copied it. {8 Some of them writing rules.} The written versions worked less
well, because a passenger enforcing a norm acts on behalf of everyone in the
car, while a passenger citing a regulation is {9 doing something else entirely}.

[5] {10} The quiet car is now standard on several American railroads and on
services in Europe and Japan. It spread by imitation rather than by policy, one
operator watching another and copying what appeared to work. {11 Copied from line to line without central
direction, the same three gestures turn up wherever the car exists.} Nobody
{12 designed} them.`,
