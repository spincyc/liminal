  title: "Testimony",
  intro: "This passage is adapted from an essay on the practice of oral history.",
  content: `The standard objection to oral history is that memory is unreliable, and the standard
objection is correct. People misdate events by years. They import details from photographs
they saw afterwards and from accounts they have heard since. They compress a sequence of
occasions into one occasion and remember the composite. Under questioning they will
confidently supply weather, clothing, and dialogue for a day they can be shown to have spent
elsewhere. None of this is contested by anyone who conducts interviews for a living; the
literature on it was largely written by oral historians.

What the objection assumes is that an interview is a way of finding out what happened, and
that a document would be better. For a great many questions the document is better, and a
competent oral historian will say so. If the question is when a factory closed, consult the
company records. The interview is not competing with the archive for that job.

The job it does is different, and the clearest way to see it is to notice what a written
record of a strike contains. It contains dates, resolutions, numbers present, and the terms
eventually agreed. It does not contain what it was like to cross a line where your
neighbour was standing, or the fact that the thing people remember about that winter is not
the settlement but a particular van that brought soup. Those are not decorations on the
historical record. They are the content of the event for the people who were in it, and
there is no document anywhere that holds them, because nobody at the time thought to write
down what everyone already knew.

Alessandro Portelli made the sharpest version of this argument out of an error. Workers in
Terni, in Italy, consistently misremembered the date of the death of a man shot by police in
1949, placing it in 1953, during a very large round of layoffs. The mistake is documented
and uniform across many interviews. Portelli's point was that the error is itself the
finding. The community had attached the killing to the layoffs because that is where it
belonged in the meaning of their own history, and no document records that connection,
because it is not a fact about 1949. It is a fact about how a town understood what had been
done to it.

This is a strong argument and it can be pushed too far, which some of its inheritors have
done. If every error is a symbolic truth, nothing an interviewee says can be wrong, and the
practice loses the ability to be corrected by anything. The discipline's answer has been
procedural rather than theoretical. Interviews are checked against documents where documents
exist, and the discrepancies are published rather than smoothed over. Recordings are
archived so that a later researcher can hear the question that produced an answer, which
frequently explains the answer. Interviewers are trained to ask open questions, because a
question containing its own answer will get it back.

The remaining difficulty is one the field has not solved and does not pretend to. An
interview is made by two people. The account a man gives of a strike depends on who is
asking, what they seem to think, and what the speaker takes the recording to be for, and
those are not noise to be filtered out because there is no version of the conversation
without them. What can be done is to record the conditions, name the interviewer, and leave
the tape. What cannot be done is to obtain the account the person would have given to
nobody. There is no such account. A memory that has never been asked for is not a purer
version of the same thing; it is a different thing, and it is not available to a historian
or to anyone else, including the person who is carrying it.`,
