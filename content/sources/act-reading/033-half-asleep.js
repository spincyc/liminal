  title: "Half Asleep",
  intro: "This passage is adapted from an article on sleep in animals.",
  content: `A mallard sleeping at the edge of a row of mallards keeps one eye open. This is not a
figure of speech and not a matter of dozing lightly. The eye is open, it is pointed away from
the group, and an electrode on the skull shows that the hemisphere connected to it is
producing the fast, low-voltage activity of waking, while the other hemisphere produces the
slow waves of deep sleep. Move the bird to the middle of the row and within a few nights it
stops doing this and sleeps with both hemispheres at once. Move it back to the end and the
open eye returns, on the outward-facing side.

Unihemispheric slow-wave sleep was first described in dolphins in the 1960s and has since
been found in every cetacean examined, in eared seals while they are in water but not on
land, and in many birds. It is not a curiosity at the margin of sleep research. It is the
strongest available evidence about what sleep is for, because it shows what an animal will
give up when circumstances make sleeping expensive, and what it will not.

What gets given up is half the brain's rest at a time, and the cost is real: a hemisphere
that has slept unihemispherically shows a rebound afterwards, sleeping more deeply when the
animal is next in a position to sleep with both. The system is not free. What is never given
up, in any species examined, is sleep itself. A dolphin swimming continuously for weeks after
giving birth does not stop sleeping; it sleeps in halves. This is the fact that has closed
off a whole family of theories. If sleep were merely a way of keeping an animal still and out
of trouble during hours when it cannot forage — the immobilisation hypothesis, which was
serious and had good arguments — then an animal that must keep swimming would simply stop
sleeping. None of them do. They pay a large price to keep something, which means the
something is doing work.

The nature of that work is where the agreement ends. One family of explanations is about
maintenance: clearing metabolic products that accumulate during waking, restoring cellular
supplies, repairing what use damages. A second is about information: consolidating what was
learned during the day, and, in one influential version, weakening the synapses that grew
during waking so that the brain begins the next day with capacity available. The two are not
exclusive and most researchers hold some combination. Unihemispheric sleep bears on both,
because in a bird sleeping half at a time you can compare the two hemispheres of one animal,
with everything else held constant.

Those comparisons have been done and they support the information side more cleanly than the
maintenance side. A pigeon trained on a task using one eye shows more slow-wave activity, on
the following night, in the hemisphere that did the learning. That is difficult to explain by
any account in which sleep is a housekeeping process running on a fixed schedule.

There is a further observation whose implications are not settled. Birds at the end of a row
face outwards, and which end a bird occupies is not random: subordinate birds get the ends.
The sleep architecture of a flock is therefore a map of its social structure, and a bird's
sleep quality depends on its position in a hierarchy it did not choose. Whether that has
consequences over a season — for immune function, for learning, for survival — has been
asked and not yet answered, mostly because following individual wild birds through a winter
is difficult in ways that have nothing to do with sleep.`,
