  intro: "Passage A is adapted from an account of microcredit written by a development practitioner. Passage B is adapted from a review of the evidence by an economist.",
  content: `PASSAGE A

The formal banking system was built to lend against collateral, and a woman who owns a
sewing machine, a stall, and no land has none that a bank recognises. For most of the
twentieth century this was treated as a fact about her rather than about the bank. The
consequence was that credit at reasonable rates stopped at a particular income and below it
the only lender was a local moneylender charging by the day.

Microcredit began from the observation that the missing thing was not creditworthiness but
a mechanism. Grameen Bank's method, refined through the 1980s, replaced collateral with a
group: five borrowers who receive loans in sequence, and whose access to the next loan
depends on the repayments of the others. The group screens its own members, because nobody
wants to be tied to somebody who will not repay, and monitors them afterwards, because
everybody's interest depends on it. The information a bank could not obtain about a borrower
is already held by the four people who live on her street.

The repayment rates that followed were the finding that changed the field. They ran above
ninety-five per cent, sustained over years, in populations that formal lenders had written
off as untouchable. That number is not in dispute and it did something no argument could
have done: it demonstrated that the poor were not a bad credit risk, and that the problem
had been in the instrument. By 2010 well over a hundred million households held such a loan.

The design has been copied, adapted, and in places abandoned in favour of individual
lending, which the same institutions now offer to borrowers with a repayment history behind
them. That progression is worth noticing. A woman who has repaid eight group loans has
built something a bank does recognise, and she built it out of nothing but her own conduct,
recorded by an institution that was willing to write it down.

PASSAGE B

Everything in the account above is true, and the conclusion usually drawn from it is not.

The repayment rates are real. What they measure is whether a loan is repaid, which is a
question about the lending mechanism, not about what the loan did for the borrower. Those
are different questions and for twenty years the first was allowed to answer the second.

The second question was finally addressed properly by randomised trials, run in six
countries and published together in 2015. Access to microcredit was expanded in randomly
chosen areas and not in others, and households were followed. The results were remarkably
consistent. Businesses were started, and business investment rose. Household income did not
rise detectably. Consumption did not rise. Children's schooling did not improve, women's
decision-making within the household did not shift measurably, and none of the effects grew
over the following three years.

The trials also found no evidence for the harms the strongest critics had alleged. Borrowers
were not driven into spirals of debt at any scale that showed up in the data. What the
studies describe is neither a transformation nor a catastrophe. It is a financial product
that works as a financial product: it lets a household move money across time, which is
genuinely useful, and which is not the same thing as lifting anybody out of poverty.

The reason this matters is that the transformative claim crowded out the modest one. Two
decades of attention and capital went to credit rather than to the interventions with larger
measured effects on the same outcomes — cash transfers, deworming, asset grants to the very
poorest — partly because those look like charity and credit looked like enterprise. If the
field had said from the beginning that it was building useful financial infrastructure for
people the banks would not serve, it would have been telling the truth and it would have
been a considerable achievement. It said something larger, and the correction has cost the
smaller claim some of the credit it deserves.`,
