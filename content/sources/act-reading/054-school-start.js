  title: "First Bell",
  intro: "This passage is adapted from an article on the debate over school start times.",
  content: `The biological finding is not in dispute and has not been for twenty years. At puberty
the timing of the circadian system shifts later by about two hours, in every population that
has been measured, and it shifts back in the early twenties. A sixteen-year-old told to be
asleep at ten is being asked to sleep at what their body treats as eight in the evening.
Most cannot. The shift is not a preference, it is not caused by screens, and it appears in
adolescents with no access to electric light at all.

Set against that, a school day beginning at half past seven requires a rising time of about
six, and the arithmetic produces a chronic deficit of one to two hours a night through the
school week, partly repaid at weekends by a sleep pattern that then makes Monday worse.

The intervention follows obviously: start later. Districts that have done so have been
studied more carefully than most education reforms, because the change is sharp, dated, and
applies to everybody at once. The results are consistent. Students sleep between twenty and
forty-five minutes longer on school nights — less than the delay, because bedtimes drift
later too, but a real gain. Attendance improves. Reported daytime sleepiness falls. In
districts with the necessary records, crash rates among teenaged drivers fall in the morning
hours, which is the single most robust finding in the literature and the one least often
quoted.

Academic effects are smaller and less consistent than advocates usually suggest. Some studies
find modest improvements in grades; others find none; the honest summary is that the health
and safety case is strong and the attainment case is weak. That distinction matters, because
the reform is usually sold on attainment and then evaluated on it.

The reason the change is difficult has almost nothing to do with any of this. A school
district's start times are the visible end of a transport system. Most districts run each bus
on two or three routes in sequence — high school first, then middle, then elementary —
because running them simultaneously would require two or three times the buses and drivers.
Move the high school later and either the elementary schools move earlier, putting the
youngest children at stops in the dark, or the district buys a fleet it does not have.

Around that constraint sits everything else. Athletic practice uses the last daylight of the
afternoon and competes with other districts on a shared schedule. Older students work
shifts. Families with two jobs have arranged childcare around a bell that has not moved in
thirty years, and a change of an hour is not an inconvenience to them but a crisis requiring
a new arrangement they may not be able to make.

None of these is an argument that the start time is correct. They are the reasons a correct
change is expensive, and they explain a pattern that recurs: districts adopt the reform, meet
the transport cost in the second year, and quietly reverse it, and the reversal is not
reported by anybody. Where the change has held, it has usually been because a state
legislature imposed it on every district at once, which removes the competitive problem in
athletics and forces the transport question to be solved rather than avoided.

The literature's own conclusion is unglamorous. This is not a case where evidence is
contested or where a lobby is suppressing a finding. It is a case where the evidence is
clear, the beneficiaries are children who do not vote, the costs are concentrated, immediate,
and land on a budget line somebody has to defend, and the benefits are diffuse and arrive
later. Reforms with that shape are hard whatever the evidence says, and treating the
difficulty as ignorance is the mistake advocates most often make.`,
