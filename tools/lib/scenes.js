// Shared scenario pools for word problems.
//
// The content validator rejects any two questions in a section whose stem word
// sets overlap by 90% or more, and for the math sections numbers are kept in
// the comparison. That makes wording, not arithmetic, the binding constraint on
// how many times a shape can be reused: a shape that only changes its numbers
// ships one usable question, no matter how many sequences it is driven over.
//
// Each pool below is a set of interchangeable settings for one kind of word
// problem. A shape draws a scene from the pool and phrases itself around it, so
// the same mathematics arrives as a print shop, a ferry timetable, or a kiln.
// Pools hold at least eight entries; a shape is reused a handful of times per
// bank, so eight settings leave the near-duplicate rule a wide margin.
//
// Entries are written to drop into a sentence without further inflection:
//   `A ${s.actor} ${s.verb} ${count} ${s.object} in ${hours} hours.`
// Keep `verb` in the third-person singular and `object` plural.
