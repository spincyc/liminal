// ACT Reading is assembled, not generated.
//
// A reading question cannot be produced from a template: the answer has to sit
// in a particular sentence of a particular passage, and the distractors have to
// be misreadings a real student would make of *that* passage. So the passages
// and their question sets are authored by hand in content/sources/act-reading/,
// and this script's job is assembly and enforcement — turning authored sets
// into bank records, balancing answer positions inside each difficulty tier,
// and writing the shared passages to content/passages/act-reading.json.
//
//   node tools/generators/generate-act-reading.js            # rebuild from the authored sets
//
// Run `node tools/check-passages.js` first: it enforces the authoring rules
// (choice length matching, distractor reasons, domain coverage, tier and domain
// totals) that this script assumes have already been met.

const STRATEGIES = {
  "main idea": "Read the opening and closing paragraphs first and state the passage's point in your own words before looking at the choices; the key will match that sentence without narrowing it to one paragraph or widening it past the text.",
  "theme": "Find the moment the passage generalises beyond its own events, then choose the option that keeps both halves of the idea it states rather than the more quotable half.",
  "summary": "Reduce each part of the section to a clause, then pick the option that covers all of them; a summary that omits one part is wrong even when everything in it is true.",
  "sequence": "Fix the order of events from the passage's own time markers before comparing choices, since a plausible order is easy to invent and the text usually fixes it in one clause.",
  "cause and effect": "Locate the sentence that states the cause directly — it is nearly always joined to the effect by *because*, *since*, or a colon — and prefer it to a cause you have supplied yourself.",
  "comparison": "State each side in one clause of your own before reading the options, then keep the option that names the point on which the two actually differ rather than a difference the passage never raises.",
  "logical inference": "Find the sentences the inference must rest on and take the smallest step they support; the key is the option you could defend by pointing at the text, not the most interesting one.",
  "conclusion": "Gather the passage's own claims on the question, then choose the conclusion that needs no premise the passage has not supplied.",
  "locate detail": "Go back to the passage and find the sentence the question points at before reading any choice, then check the whole sentence, since these items usually turn on a clause after the obvious phrase.",
  "interpret detail": "Read the detail together with the sentence that frames it; the passage almost always says what the detail is doing, and the key restates that rather than the detail itself.",
  "organization": "Label each paragraph with the job it performs in three or four words, then match the sequence of labels against each option and reject any that promotes a minor passage into the spine.",
  "function": "Ask what the passage would lose if the sentence were deleted, then choose the option naming that loss; a choice that merely restates the sentence's content is not a function.",
  "meaning in context": "Substitute each choice into the sentence and keep the one the surrounding clause supports; these items are decided by the words around the term, not by the term's commonest meaning.",
  "connotation": "Weigh the attitude the word carries in this sentence against the passage's stance, and reject choices that fit the dictionary sense but not the tone.",
  "figurative language": "Identify what is being compared to what, then choose the option that names the property being transferred rather than one that reads the figure literally.",
  "author's purpose": "Ask what the author is trying to accomplish with this material rather than what it says, and read the sentence immediately after it, which usually states the purpose outright.",
  "perspective": "Separate what the passage reports from what it endorses; the key describes the writer's own stance, and the strongest distractors describe a view the writer merely reports.",
  "narration": "Check the pronouns and ask whose thoughts you are actually given; the answer follows from what the narration can and cannot see rather than from the events.",
  "claims and evidence": "State the claim in one sentence, then keep only the detail that would be hard to explain if the claim were false; details that are merely consistent with the claim are the standard distractor.",
  "reasoning": "Write the argument out as its stated steps, then look for the assumption that has to hold for the conclusion to follow, which is what these items almost always ask for.",
  "strengthen or weaken": "Name the claim's weak point first, then choose the option that bears on that point; new facts that are interesting but land somewhere else are the commonest trap.",
  "compare perspectives": "Find what each passage grants before you look for what divides them, and reject options describing disagreements the two texts do not actually have.",
  "synthesize information": "List what the second passage concedes, check it against what the first asserts, and keep the statement neither would dispute.",
  "integrate table data": "Read the row and column headings before the numbers, decide whether the question asks about a value or about a change, and compute the comparison rather than reading off the largest figure.",
  "integrate graph data": "Fix the axes and units before reading any point, then locate the extreme or trend the question names rather than the most visually striking feature.",
