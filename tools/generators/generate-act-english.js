const STRATEGIES = {
  purpose: "State what the passage or paragraph is trying to accomplish, then choose the option that serves that purpose without narrowing or exaggerating it.",
  relevance: "Name the paragraph's focus before judging the proposed detail; keep only information that directly develops that focus.",
  support: "Identify the claim that needs support, then choose the concrete detail that most directly proves it rather than merely sharing its topic.",
  organization: "Label the job of each sentence or paragraph, then place the material where that job creates the clearest logical progression.",
  introductions: "Choose an opening that establishes the passage's specific subject and direction without becoming broader or narrower than what follows.",
  conclusions: "Choose the ending that synthesizes the passage's established point without adding a new subject, claim, or recommendation.",
  transitions: "Describe the exact relationship between the ideas first—contrast, cause, example, sequence, or addition—then select the transition that names it.",
  precision: "Use the surrounding sentence to identify the exact meaning, degree, and tone required before comparing the wording of the choices.",
  conciseness: "Remove words that repeat an idea already expressed, then confirm that the shortest remaining choice preserves every necessary meaning.",
  "style and tone": "Identify the passage's audience, purpose, and level of formality, then reject choices that shift voice or sound conspicuously out of place.",
  consistency: "Find the passage's controlling tense, point of view, terminology, or tone and choose the option that maintains it without an unexplained shift.",
  "clause relationships": "Classify each clause as independent or dependent before choosing punctuation or a connector; the clause structure determines which joins are grammatical.",
  modifiers: "Locate the word a descriptive phrase is meant to modify and place that word next to the phrase so the sentence cannot attach it elsewhere.",
  parallelism: "Identify the grammatical pattern established by the coordinated items, then make every item follow that same pattern.",
  "subject-verb agreement": "Find the head noun of the subject, ignore nouns inside interrupting phrases, and match the verb to that head noun in number.",
  pronouns: "Identify the pronoun's exact antecedent, then match it in number and person while keeping the reference unambiguous.",
  "verb forms": "Map the sequence of events and use the tense or verb form that expresses that timing consistently with the surrounding sentence.",
  comparisons: "Name the two things being compared and make sure the choice places logically comparable items in parallel grammatical forms.",
  commas: "Identify the sentence structure before listening for a pause; use commas only where the clause, phrase, or series requires them.",
  "semicolons and colons": "Check whether the words before the mark form a complete clause, then use a semicolon to join clauses or a colon to introduce what follows.",
  apostrophes: "Decide whether the noun is possessive, plural, or a contraction, then place the apostrophe according to that function.",
  "dashes and parentheses": "Decide whether the inserted material is nonessential and choose a matched pair of marks whose emphasis fits the sentence.",
